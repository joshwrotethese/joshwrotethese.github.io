### Death Breath 

I’ve been wondering
Lately
If more people die
On the in-breath
Or on the out

Or perhaps in the narrow pause
In between?
They say that the heart slows
On the exhale
And then picks up again
With the inhale

I’d like to think people
Pass
Relaxed
At the end of their last expression of air
Heart soft
Content
A job well done

### Ketamine

Heart surging 
A meteor of pure kinetic power
Gracing my consciousness
Sucked down an hours worth
Of a ketamine lollipop
On Viva’s couch 

Laying still
Eyes masked
Feeling the rise and fall of so much love
The energy behind all the thoughts
Pressing me home 

Seeing the quick escapes
Of those feral, alert parts
Grabbing them by their necks or tails
Only to have them disappear from my grasp

Finding Him
Again
Playing with his toys
Waiting patiently for Her 
Holding up his toys 
To her gauzy form
Her smiling, looking on
Tall and thin and comforting

Trying, vainly
To turn him around to see
Me
Not a woman
But a love on offer

At some point
A kind of meeting
A half-in hand-holding
An agreement to move together
Ties of a bridge
That we might walk over 

Guessing
Perhaps correctly
What he wants and how he got there
Understanding, hopefully,
What is good and what to offer
And maybe, to make my life
Easier
Less bothered

### Just Friends

Today is raining
I am wet
I told a girl
How things have changed since we met 

And she told me
Just like Elyse May did back then
“No, josh malina, 
I will not be your girlfriend”

Sad stuff
That’s for sure
But I already
Knew the score

Or part of me did
But one held out
The one loves love 
The one who shouts 

“Hey hey
Find someone to love!
We like this one
Go get her bruv!”

Well I tried
I meekly mentioned my feelings
And she easily replied
That’s not what, with you, I am seeking

It’s tempting to make
Much of this loss
But as the Chinese farmer says
We don’t know how things turn out, hoss

So feel you feelings
And offer what’s needed within
Your love is everlasting
No need to take this on the chin

I guess the part
That still feels squirrelly
Is the one who worries
Did I ruin a friendship, prematurely?

Well it was risk
And it may bear out
A severance, a void
Something I’d be sad about  

Because in my natural
Human state
I find loss difficult 
To navigate 

That’s what needs 
My love the most
My inward gaze
A hug, a toast?

Hey little guy
I know you’re scared
You worry about being alone
That is fair 

Look at me
See into my eyes
There’s someone who cares
Who would rather die
Then have you feel lonely
Cold and scared
I’m here for you
I’m here to care

That little bit
Gets him curious
He wonders if 
My claims aren’t spurious

Oh little boy
Don’t you know
You’re the one 
I want to show

How life can be
When you trust
That you’re not alone
That I am here 
I see you there
I love you my dear

### Twice

Twice now
I’ve lay under some lovely girl
Bouncing,  hair flung back
Captured fully in the moment

Except for one thought:
“I will marry this girl”

Twice now
I’ve been dismissed
A similar moment never arising
For them

Here again
I find myself totally captured
Infatuated 
Fully unrequited

As if it weren’t already
Obviously true
That I’m staring up
At the wrong tree

### Rocks

What good is a poem
When you want bash
Your head
Against the rocks

### Extrovert

Hershey snores
And I feel bored
Reading today
But I yearn for more

Hiked sugarloaf yesterday
And rode to b’more the day before
Outdoor play is great
It’s the contrast I deplore

Four walls
Itchy skin
Loneliness and congestion
The critic ways in

“Stuck again,
Ruminating?
Put on your pants
The world is waiting”

A coffee shop
Offers some respite
A short conversation
That feels right

So simple
Learnt time and again
People are medicine
You’re social, man

Confessions of 
A forgetful extrovert
Happiness, oh happiness
He flails and flirts

### Wake Up

Today, now
The sun is bright
All who sleep
Must now alight 

“Come down 
From your bunks!”
the day demands,
“Bring paper and pencil.
I have a plan”

So we descend
Down elevators and stairs
Through hallways,
Under thresholds
Any preposition is fair 

To see and hear
What’s in store
A feeling
A thought
A conversation for sure 

Oh dear
I hope
That there are many
I like to talk
Friends -- I’ll take plenty 

For I am sensitive 
to the monotony
The routine, it feels,
Often quite unsatisfying

But sometimes it surprises 
Sometimes it’s good
Sometimes I get to trade my frown
To be an amiable dude
